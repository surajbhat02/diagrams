## Project Overview

MyBackendApp is a scalable backend service built using **Spring Boot** and **Java**, with **MongoDB** as the NoSQL database. It exposes RESTful APIs to support a variety of frontend clients and handles business logic, authentication, and data persistence.

This service is designed with a focus on modularity, performance, and easy maintenance.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints adhering to best practices  
- JWT-based authentication and authorization  
- MongoDB schema-less design with indexing for fast queries  
- Exception handling with meaningful error responses  
- Service layer abstraction for business logic  
- Integration with third-party APIs (if applicable)  
- Unit and integration tests with JUnit and Mockito  
- Dockerized application for containerized deployments  
- Health check and monitoring endpoints

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher installed  
- Maven 3.6+ installed  
- MongoDB 6.x instance running locally or remotely  
- Docker (optional, for containerized run)  

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mybackendapp.git
cd mybackendapp
```

### Configuration

Create an `application.yml` or `application.properties` file in `src/main/resources`:

```yaml
spring:
  data:
    mongodb:
      uri: mongodb://localhost:27017/mybackenddb
  jackson:
    serialization:
      indent_output: true

jwt:
  secret: your_jwt_secret_key
  expiration: 3600000 # in milliseconds
```

Adjust settings such as MongoDB URI, JWT secrets, and other environment variables as needed.

---

## Running the Application

### Running locally via Maven

```bash
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Running with Docker

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t mybackendapp:latest .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name mybackendapp mybackendapp:latest
```

---

## API Documentation

The project uses **Swagger/OpenAPI** for API documentation.

Once running, access the API docs at:

```
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html
```

You can find example request/response schemas and try out API endpoints interactively.

---

## Database Design

The MongoDB database consists of the following main collections:

- `users` — stores user authentication and profile data  
- `orders` — holds order data with embedded documents for order items  
- `logs` — audit trail of actions and errors  

All collections use appropriate indexes on frequently queried fields (e.g., `userId`, `createdAt`).
